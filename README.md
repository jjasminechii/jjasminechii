## hi there, i'm jasmine 👋

i'm currently a junior at the university of washington studying computer science and english literature. 

my current projects center around cs education and fiddling with streamlining grading for the course(s) i TA for :)

when i'm away from my computer, i like to...
  * 🌈 read new books (very avid reader of queer literature! If you're looking for a read, I couldn't recommend [*Our Wives Under the Sea*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57921861-our-wives-under-the-sea) enough)
  * 🍣 find yummy restaurants + cafes
  * 🎥 watch movies (one of my all-time favorites: [*Arrival*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/))
  * 🍪 bake!
